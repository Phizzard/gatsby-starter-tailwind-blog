I've been meaning to write something like this for a while, going over various stumbling blocks I had built a large scale web application I _really_ shouldn't have had any business doing.

I want to quickly state that some of these mistakes can seem like no brainers and that my tips are by all means not the be all solutions. These are tips after looking back based on my personal experience.

So here goes!

## Some Background

Travel back in time to 2017 when I was a less experienced developer, a company I used to work for needed to rebuild a legacy multi-vendor e-commerce app around 15 years old. Being a small team with lots of projects on the go, I was included in this undertaking. Little did I know that I would stumble my way into being the technical lead.

I was _not_ experienced enough both technically or professionally, though I was hungry and enthusiastic to climb the ranks of the company and level up my career; money was tight with a second child on the way. I also showed up so I had that going for me. This ended up taking just over a year to launch, 5-6 months of which were crunch.
